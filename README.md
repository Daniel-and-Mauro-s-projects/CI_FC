# Compound Pendulum: Fuzzy Control

This project implements a Mamdani fuzzy inference system (FIS) to stabilize a compound pendulum using MATLAB and Simulink. The fuzzy controller improves transient response and stability compared to an open-loop system.

## Features

- Design and simulation of a fuzzy logic controller.
- Membership functions for error, error derivative, and thrust.
- Rule-based inference system for stabilization.
- Comparison of basic and enhanced fuzzy controllers.

## Results

The fuzzy controller effectively stabilizes the pendulum, reducing oscillations and improving response time. Enhancing the output variable granularity further improves performance.
